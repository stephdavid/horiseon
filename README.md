# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task

Refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

- spell check

- fix incorrect inner link - in this case, add an id

- validate the html via W3C validation service - `https://validator.w3.org/` - revealed that all images required an alt tag.

- run an accessibility checker on the page - picked up no sections and a broken link

- css validation - `https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/` - passed

- added explanatory comments to the sections of the page

- n.b. the main image is embedded and therefore does not take an alt tag - the accessibility question on whether this or not is important
